# CodeKindly::Utils

These are small utilities that I like to have around in my projects.

There is nothing terribly unique or interesting here and there are almost
certainly better ways to do things than this. These are little snippets I've
found useful in the past and continue to use through inertia.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'codekindly-utils'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install codekindly-utils

## Usage

I occasionally use these utilities in the main logic of an app, but usually
use them as conveniences in various rake tasks that are automated or part of my
general workflow.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run
`rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive
prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.
To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then
run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version,
push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
